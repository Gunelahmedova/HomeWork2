            Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815 in London - November 27, 1852 in
            Marlybon, United Kingdom) was an English mathematician. This lady, a
            mathematician by profession, is famous for writing the first program
            in history. Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first program for the
            computing machine invented by Charles Babbage, is considered the
            first programmer in the world's history. This lady also used the
            terms "cycle" and "working room" for the first time.

            In 1979-1980, the Ada programming language was created by order of
            the US Department of Defense. The main goal in creating the language
            was to create a special system for managing military objects (ships,
            planes, missiles, tanks, etc.). On February 17, 1983, the ADA
            object-oriented programming language was officially standardized by
            ANSI. This language was developed as part of a project adopted by
            the US Department of Defense to create a single programming language
            for military systems and large military computers. In addition, the
            Ada award was established in 1998 in order to perpetuate the name of
            this lady who was the first programmer.
